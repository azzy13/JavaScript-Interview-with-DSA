==> line 15 hasn't been executed but variable are hosted (a) in a separate space or memory (Script) and it was also assigned undefined but it has not been initialized 
        - this phase is called temporal dead zone until it goes to line no. 16 and temporal zone is ended
  
==> Temporal dead zone is a time since when let or const value is hoisted and till it is assigned some values.


1.  let and const are hoisted. we can't use them before initialization is result of "temporal dead zone" 
      && JS use diff memory than global execution context to store let and cost. which is reason behind "temporal dead zone"
2.  level of strictness ... var<<let<<const.

3.  var //no temporal dead zone, can redeclare and re-initialize, stored in GES
4.  let 
      //use TDZ, can't re-declare, can re-initialize, stored in separate memory 
   const 
     //use TDZ, can't re-declare, can't re-initialize, stored in separate memory
   
     
5. syntax error is similar to compile error. while type and reference error falls under run time error.
-> syntax error ... violation of JS syntax
    type error ...  while trying to re-initialize const variable
    reference error ... while trying to access variable which is not there in global memory.

      Inversion of Control :  
       - Is when you lose control of your code when u are using cb

         function - that leads what if prev function won't return anything

/* 

1. What are Promises?
     - The Promise is an object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation.[BestðŸ«¡]
     - They are just like placeholders to store a future value that will be returned after some time.
     - They contain two properties: PromiseState [ Pending ,Fulfilled ,Rejected] and PromiseResult.
     * Promises are immutable so it can't be altered 

2. Importance of Promises:
    a) Promises can help us to write trust worthy code.
    b) Promises are used to solve the problems of callbacks like inversion of control and callback hell.
    c) They give us the result prompt in three states: 1) Pending 2) Fulfilled 3) Rejected
    d) We can attach function to promise object and retrieve its value unlike callbacks no need to pass the function.
    e) Nesting can be done in Promises and with the help of that we can return the values in each individual chain.

/* 
    1. Javascript is synchronous single threaded language and it has one call stack [Present in JS Engine] and it can do one thing at a time. 
       & all the code of javascript is executed in the call stack (quickly executed whatever code comes in call stack)
    2. Whenever any JS program is run, a Global Execution Context (GEC) is created and put GEC in call stack. 
       & In GEC, now the whole code is run line by line 
    3. 'window' as global object in web-api has access to setTimeout, console, localStorage, location, fetch, web-api without window keyword as it's global

    2nd part - How Event Listeners works in JS...???? Microtask Queue has higher priority that Call back queue
    -> setTimeout register inside web api environment.
    4. whatever you call with document. eg. document.addEventListner() as part of web api as - [ DOM api]
    5. Event Loop has one job - Continuosly monitor call stack as well as callback queue, if this call stack is empty and This Event loop sees that 
       there is also a f(n) waiting to executed inside Call back Queue , it just takes the function and push it inside call stack. then call back method 
       get quickly executed & also Call back queue is quikly cleared.
    6. fetch() (goes and request a api call or network calls ) function retuns a promise
    7. Microtask Queue 
                 - Promises
                 - Mutation Observer

/* 
  To concise things:

0) Lexical environment = EC's Local Memory + Reference to Lexical Environment of its parent.
1) Lexical Environment of its parent is the scope where a function is physically present or defined. So, suppose a function x(), is defined and invoked in the GEC, when function x()'s EC is pushed in the call stack, it stores a reference to its parent's lexical environment i.e. the GEC's memory.
2) Whenever a new Execution Context is pushed in the Call Stack it holds a reference to the Lexical Environment of its parent, i.e. the EC's memory from where it was invoked.
3) Global execution context holds reference to null.
4)  Javascript engine first looks for the variable/function being accessed in the local scope of the function, and if not found, it keeps on searching the lexical environment of its parent until it finds the variable/function being accessed.
5) The mechanism mentioned in point 4 above is called SCOPE CHAIN.
6) If the variable accessed is not found in the Scope Chain, then you will get the variable is not defined error in the  browser's console.

function a() {
     console.log(b);
}
b = 10;
a(); // function a is invoked


function a() {
     c();
     function c() {

b = 10;
